This Weather Web App is a simple and user-friendly web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to fetch and display real-time weather data for any city around the world. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide current weather information including temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions like "clear sky", "rainy", or "cloudy".

The app allows users to enter the name of a city and, with a single click, retrieve the latest weather data. It features a clean, responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The application also includes basic error handling to alert the user if an invalid city is entered or if there is an issue with the API connection.

To run the application, simply download or clone the repository, open the script.js file, and insert your own API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can then launch the app by opening the index.html file in any modern web browser.

This project is ideal for beginners who are learning how to work with APIs, fetch data asynchronously in JavaScript, and build responsive user interfaces. Additional features like weather icons, multi-day forecasts, or geolocation support can be added to enhance the app further.

The project is open-source and available under the MIT License. Contributions are welcome!
